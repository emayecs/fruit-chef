# fruit-chef

This repo contains most of the files that were used by Kevin Cai, Max Chen, and Simon Hu to create the Fruit Chef game for Caltech's CS 3 class.

## Important Note:
Since the physics engine part of the project is an integral part of the CS 3 curriculum, the c files containing specific implementation details of the physics engine have been excluded from the repo.
